//!  4. allocate a (r)esult vector of the same length as x, then:
//!  5. depending on type of x, each i'th element of r becomes either:
//!     5.1 (atom x) OP (i'th element of f)
//!     5.2 (i'th element of x) OP (i'th element of f)
//!  6. finally, attempt to release memory of f and x, and return r.
